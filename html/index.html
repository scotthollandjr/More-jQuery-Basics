      <h2>Coding Flashcards</h2>
      <p>Here are some helpful definitions for words you will come across while you learn to program with JavaScript!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>A high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. <strong>JavaScript</strong> is an interpreted client-side scripting language that allows a web designer the ability to insert code into their web page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Modulo</h3>
      <p>The <strong>modulo</strong> operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Operators</h3>
      <p>An <strong>operator</strong> is an object that is capable of manipulating a value or operator. For example, in "1 + 2", the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>NaN</h3>
      <p>Short for Not a Number, <strong>NaN</strong> is an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. For example, 0/0 or the square root of a negative number would return an NaN result.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Variable Naming Conventions</h3>
      <p>A <strong>naming convention</strong> is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>+=</h3>
      <p>The addition assignment operator <strong>(+=)</strong> adds a value to a variable. For example, var x = 10; then x += 5; would return x= 15.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Function</h3>
      <p>A <strong>function</strong> is a group of instructions, also known as a named procedure, used by programming languages to return a single result or a set of results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Method</h3>
      <p>A <strong>method</strong> is a function that is a member of a class/object. The method has access to the variables and properties defined in the class/object and can perform tasks on any instances of the class/object.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Argument to a method</h3>
      <p>An <strong>argument</strong> is a value that is passed into a command, function, or routine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>String</h3>
      <p>A <strong>string</strong> is any series of characters that are interpreted literally by a script. For example, "hello world" and "LKJH019283" are both examples of strings. In computer programming, a string is usually attached to a variable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Chaining methods</h3>
      <p><strong>Method chaining</strong> is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Escape</h3>
      <p><strong>Escape</strong> is also shorthand for an escape character, an escape is a single backward slash ( \ ) in Linux, programming, and regular expressions that perform a special function or to have a character treated as plain text and not a function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Alert</h3>
      <p>In JavaScript, an <strong>alert</strong> is a type of "pop-up" message to users of a script. An alert could be anything from notifying the user of an error to saying a short phrase such as "Hi".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Commenting code</h3>
      <p>A comment is a programmer-readable annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Booleans</h3>
      <p>A <strong>Boolean</strong> or bool consists of operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. Booleans are often used in programming and in Internet search engines. Boolean expressions are expressions that result in the value of either TRUE or FALSE.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Undefined</h3>
      <p>Anything that lacks a description or has not been declared is considered <strong>undefined</strong>. For example, in computer programming if a variable had not been declared when the program or script is run you will receive a "no value", "not defined", "unbound", "undefined" error message.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Parameter</h3>
      <p>Function <strong>parameters</strong> are the names listed in the function definition, separated by a comma.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="flashCard">
      <h3>Return</h3>
      <p>In programming, <strong>return</strong> is a statement that tells the program to leave the subroutine and return to the return address, directly after where the subroutine was called. In most programming languages, the return statement is either "return" or "return value", where value is a variable or other information coming back from the subroutine.</p>
    </div>
